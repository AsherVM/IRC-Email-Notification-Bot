# IRC-Email-Notification-Bot
Bot to connect to a IRC channel and notify when the set email has a new email

Reviewing my old repos 8 years later, most this script appears to be copied from here:
  https://www.codingforum.net/forum/server-side-development/php/post-a-php-snippet/94015-connecting-to-an-irc-server-with-php
(for the IRC connection/bot functions)

Looks like I added a simple checkEmail function that utilized the SendCommand function, this was used for BitChocolate.com to notify us of new Chocolate Bitcoin orders.
